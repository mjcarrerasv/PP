C2
Here we re-write the code as a function of the order, n, vs the folder C1 where the code is a function of sp.
Here the timing is: shocks (nu and lam) are realized, then decisions are made
There are two inputs and only foreign inputs face dtimes and have inventories


##
C3
parallel via distributed the C2 code
 options are threds and distributed
 Distributed requires you to establish workers and create everywhere vs shared variables

 Distributed is faster than Threads (almost double...)

 Plus include a code with n_grid 

##
C4
Now I add domestic and foreign inventories with parallel distributed code.
Plus include an n_grid for each input. Faster?
